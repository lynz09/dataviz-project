## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is the [International football results](https://www.kaggle.com/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017).


## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a line chart and it hows the number of different types of competitions from 2010 to 2020.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

* Who is the best team of all time?
* Which teams dominated different eras of football?
* What trends have there been in international football throughout the ages - home advantage, total goals scored, distribution of teams' strength etc?
* Can we say anything about geopolitics from football fixtures - how has the number of countries changed, which teams like to play each other?
* Which countries host the most matches where they themselves are not participating in?
* How much, if at all, does hosting a major tournament help a country's chances in the tournament?

## Sketches

The following are my sketches of how the project will look like:

* show the places where FIFA World Cup matches have been played on a map.
* show the cumulative sum of matches for top teams.
* show the description of games per year: trend,common game type,etc.
* show the win and loss rates.

## Ideas for Interaction

The final deliverables of project would have:

* World Map: In the world map, the user can zoom in and out to see where all world football matches have been played.
* Bar charts:In the bar chart of sketch 1, the user can select the country that appears on top 10 and the map will show statistics of the selected country.


## Open Questions

I am not sure how to visualize entire data on a global map. Also how to use animation is a challenge job for different types of variables.

## Schedule of delivrables

* World map: learn how to create a map where all world football matches have been played.(10/14/2020)
* Word map zoom in and out.(10/17/2020)
* Top teams: create the bar chart and make a menu to show the top 3 teams in different years.(10/20/2020)
* Interaction between map and bar chart: select the year and make the map show data of that country.(10/27/2020)
* Description of games per year: draw the bar chart.(10/29/2020)
* Win and loss rates: Calculate the win and loss rates and rank top 10 teams according to win rates.(11/4/2020)
* Debugging and checking.(11/11/2020)
