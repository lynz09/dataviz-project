The data I propose to visualize for my project is the [International football results](https://www.kaggle.com/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017).

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Who is the best team of all time
* Which teams dominated different eras of football
* What trends have there been in international football throughout the ages - home advantage, total goals scored, distribution of teams' strength etc
* Can we say anything about geopolitics from football fixtures - how has the number of countries changed, which teams like to play each other
* Which countries host the most matches where they themselves are not participating in
* How much, if at all, does hosting a major tournament help a country's chances in the tournament

## Sketches

The following are my sketches of how the project will look like:

* show the cumulative sum of matches for top teams.
* show the description of games per year: trend,common game type, etc.
* show the win and loss rates.



## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)
