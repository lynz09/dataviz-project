## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is the [International football results](https://www.kaggle.com/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017).


## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a line chart and it hows the number of different types of competitions from 2010 to 2020.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Who is the best team of all time
* Which teams dominated different eras of football
* What trends have there been in international football throughout the ages - home advantage, total goals scored, distribution of teams' strength etc
* Can we say anything about geopolitics from football fixtures - how has the number of countries changed, which teams like to play each other
* Which countries host the most matches where they themselves are not participating in
* How much, if at all, does hosting a major tournament help a country's chances in the tournament

## Sketches

The following are my sketches of how the project will look like:

* show the cumulative sum of matches for top teams.
* show the description of games per year: trend,common game type, etc.
* show the win and loss rates.

## Open Questions

I am not sure how to visualize entire data on a global map. Also how to use animation is a challenge job for different types of variables.
