## Data
The data I propose to visualize for my project is the [International football results](https://www.kaggle.com/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017).

## Prototypes

## Questions & Tasks
The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:
\item Who is the best team of all time
2.Which teams dominated different eras of football
3.What trends have there been in international football throughout the ages - home advantage, total goals scored, distribution of teams' strength etc
4.Can we say anything about geopolitics from football fixtures - how has the number of countries changed, which teams like to play each other
5.Which countries host the most matches where they themselves are not participating in
6.How much, if at all, does hosting a major tournament help a country's chances in the tournament

## Sketches
The following are my sketches of how the project will be look like:
